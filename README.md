# Early RTL Delay Prediction

This repository is dedicated to my ongoing research work on **early delay prediction from RTL designs using machine learning**, inspired by recent papers like:

- _"Early RTL delay prediction using neural networks"_

## 📌 Objective

To build an efficient ML-based or hybrid algorithm that can predict timing metrics (e.g., delay, slew) directly from RTL, without full synthesis, targeting both accuracy and generalizability.

## 🧱 Project Structure

- `data/` — Datasets and extracted RTL features  
- `models/` — ML models and training scripts  
- `scripts/` — Feature extractors, RTL parsers, utilities  
- `experiments/` — Logs, plots, evaluation metrics  
- `daily_logs/` — Markdown files tracking daily progress

## 📅 Daily Research Updates

I record my daily research log in [`daily_logs/`](./daily_logs/) folder. Each log is named by date and contains:

- What I worked on
- What I learned
- Issues faced
- Next steps
