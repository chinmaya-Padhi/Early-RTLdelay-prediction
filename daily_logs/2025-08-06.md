#### 1. 🎯 Problem Statement
  
>   in  digital chip design flow starts with spec. which are mapped to RTL model using diff. arch. , by doing so , a h/w designer predicts and resolves time-critical parts to achieve an RTL-design that meets all constraints after synthesis. However, wrong predictions can be detected only later in the design flow, thus leading to long design iterations.
>   Traditional methods used to estimate delay early in the design process either work only for specific types of components or become very slow and inefficient when used on large circuits.
>  This paper addresses the problem of predicting delay and slew metrics directly from RTL, early in the design flow, using machine learning.

#### 2. 🎯 Motivation

- Speed up design iterations by predicting timing at RTL

- Reduce dependency on EDA tools like OpenSTA for every update

- Enable early PPA estimation (Performance, Power, Area) during architectural exploration

#### 3. 🛠️ Methodology


#### 3.1. RTL Design Generation (MetaRTL HW Generator)
•	Random RTL circuits are generated using MetaRTL based on:
- Primitive component types (logic, mux, demux, branch, arithmetic)
-	Configurable bit widths, number of inputs, and connections

##### 3.2.RTL → Gate-Level Netlist (Yosys)
-	The Verilog RTL designs are synthesized using Yosys (open-source logic synthesis tool).
-	Output: Gate-level netlist mapped to 40nm CMOS cells.

##### 3.3.Static Timing Analysis (OpenSTA)
•	The synthesized netlist is analyzed with OpenSTA to extract:
-	Pin-to-pin slew (rise/fall)
-	Pin-to-pin delay (rise/fall)
-	Timing arcs include:
-o	Register-to-Register
-o	Input-to-Output
-o	Register-to-Output
-o	Input-to-Register

##### 3.4. Feature Extraction & Dataset Construction
•	For each pin-to-pin connection:
###### -	Extract features like:
-	Component type (one-hot or embedded)
-	Bit widths (input/output)
-	Number of inputs/outputs
-	Fanout (input/output connections)
-	Slew-in
-	Pin index
###### 	Extract labels (targets):
	Slew out (rise/fall)
	Delay (rise/fall)
###### 	Create two datasets:
- 	DS-I: Logic & MUX only
- 	DS-II: All 37 primitives (logic + mux + arithmetic + branch)

##### 3.5. Model Training (MLP / TabMLP)
###### 	Two architectures:
-	MLP: Uses one-hot encoded component type
-	TabMLP: Uses embedded component type + numeric features
###### 	Objective: Multi-output regression for:
-	Slew rise
-	Slew fall
-	Delay rise
-	Delay fall
###### 	Use TPE (Tree Parzen Estimator) for hyperparameter tuning

##### 3.6. Slew Propagation Algorithm
-	For components not connected to primary inputs:
    o	Use predicted output slew of previous gate as input slew
-	Predict sequentially from input gates to deeper logic
-	Slew propagation affects delay prediction accuracy

##### 3.7. Model Evaluation
-	Evaluate on 4-bit adders (BKA, KSA, SKA)
-	Metrics used:
    o	R² score
    o	MAE, MSE
-	Compare predictions with OpenSTA results
-	Test generalization to unknown input slew values

##### 3.8. Runtime Benchmark
-	Compare runtime of NN models vs. full Yosys + OpenSTA flow
-	ML models are ~8.4× faster than synthesis + STA tools

#### 4. 📉 Limitations

- What are the weaknesses in the paper?
  - Only supports combinational components (no sequential logic in experiments)
  - Prediction may degrade with large designs
  - Doesn’t cover power or area estimation
  - Fixed node (40 nm ) 

---

#### 5. 💡 Key Takeaways

- Early delay prediction is feasible and fast with ML
- Embedding-based models like TabMLP are more effective
- Slew propagation is critical for accurate delay estimation

---

#### 6. 💭 My Ideas & Extensions

- Add support for sequential logic
- Extend to power or area prediction
- The Verilog RTL designs are synthesized using Yosys insted of that we can use cadence to gate more accurate value .
- different node support (28nm,22nm etc)

✍️ **my Notes:**  
>Could build a dataset from my own RTL examples
Idea: Combine data augmentation + hierarchy parsing for richer training
