#### 1. 🎯 Problem Statement

✍️ **My Notes:**  
>   in  digital chip design flow starts with spec. which are mapped to RTL model using diff. arch. , by doing so , a h/w designer predicts and resolves time-critical parts to achieve an RTL-design that meets all constraints after synthesis. However, wrong predictions can be detected only later in the design flow, thus leading to long design iterations.
>   Traditional methods used to estimate delay early in the design process either work only for specific types of components or become very slow and inefficient when used on large circuits.

#### 2. 🎯 Motivation

✍️ **My Notes:**  
>  This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to estimate pin-to-pin delays in RTL combinational circuits. The motivation is to improve early delay prediction accuracy by combining slew and delay estimation, as they are interdependent. To train the ML model, the authors generate synthetic RTL components using a model-driven hardware generator. Ground truth values for delays and slews are obtained using open-source tools like Yosys (for logic synthesis) and OpenSTA (for static timing analysis). This allows them to build a diverse dataset and overcome challenges like data scarcity and high synthesis times in traditional methods.

#### 3. 🛠️ Methodology

✍️ **Your Notes:**

#### 3.1. RTL Design Generation (MetaRTL HW Generator)
•	Random RTL circuits are generated using MetaRTL based on:
o	Primitive component types (logic, mux, demux, branch, arithmetic)
o	Configurable bit widths, number of inputs, and connections

##### 3.2.RTL → Gate-Level Netlist (Yosys)
•	The Verilog RTL designs are synthesized using Yosys (open-source logic synthesis tool).
•	Output: Gate-level netlist mapped to 40nm CMOS cells.

##### 3.3.Static Timing Analysis (OpenSTA)
•	The synthesized netlist is analyzed with OpenSTA to extract:
o	Pin-to-pin slew (rise/fall)
o	Pin-to-pin delay (rise/fall)
•	Timing arcs include:
o	Register-to-Register
o	Input-to-Output
o	Register-to-Output
o	Input-to-Register

##### 3.4. Feature Extraction & Dataset Construction
•	For each pin-to-pin connection:
o	Extract features like:
	Component type (one-hot or embedded)
	Bit widths (input/output)
	Number of inputs/outputs
	Fanout (input/output connections)
	Slew-in
	Pin index
o	Extract labels (targets):
	Slew out (rise/fall)
	Delay (rise/fall)
•	Create two datasets:
o	DS-I: Logic & MUX only
o	DS-II: All 37 primitives (logic + mux + arithmetic + branch)

##### 3.5. Model Training (MLP / TabMLP)
•	Two architectures:
o	MLP: Uses one-hot encoded component type
o	TabMLP: Uses embedded component type + numeric features
•	Objective: Multi-output regression for:
o	Slew rise
o	Slew fall
o	Delay rise
o	Delay fall
•	Use TPE for hyperparameter tuning

##### 3.6. Slew Propagation Algorithm
•	For components not connected to primary inputs:
o	Use predicted output slew of previous gate as input slew
•	Predict sequentially from input gates to deeper logic
•	Slew propagation affects delay prediction accuracy

##### 3.7. Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate on 4-bit adders (BKA, KSA, SKA)
•	Metrics used:
o	R² score
o	MAE, MSE
•	Compare predictions with OpenSTA results
•	Test generalization to unknown input slew values

##### 3.8. Runtime Benchmark
•	Compare runtime of NN models vs. full Yosys + OpenSTA flow
•	ML models are ~8.4× faster than synthesis + STA tools
