### ‚úÖ Work Done
####  Exploring Introduction part

- Before that now [10.50am] i am just reading the intro part let's see what i get .
  
  ‚úçÔ∏è **My Thoughts:**  
>  IC design is a complex & itrative process , initially u read the spec , then design rtl , write constraint then map with *.lib then i get the gate level netlist , after finishing the synthesis we get the PDA value all those are done by the EDA tools, before fabrication the PPA value is validated .  Principally, designs must meet timing constraints and work at the desired clock frequency.
>  Classical methods estimating delay from a higher level of abstraction use **polynomial, macromodeling, and analytical** approaches.
> **They have several drawbacks:** they are slow, constrained by the type of components, computationally expensive, or give only a very rough estimation.
> here ml plays the role it having ability to predict with high accuracy.
> This paper proposes Neural Networks (NNs) for pin-to-pin component delay estimation of RTL components in Application-Specific IC designs.

###    General flow for dataset collection
![General flow for dataset collection](../image/General_flow_for_dataset_collection.png)
-  In this paper, the training data are built using a model-driven HW generator framework.
-  ML models using one-hot encoded and embedding feature vectors are trained and fine-tuned. The trained models are used to get estimated pin-to-pin delay values. 
- They sequentially predict slew and delay values per component and then propagate the predicted slew along the delay path.
-  When training a model with a dataset of logic gates and multiplexers, a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using one-hot encoding achieves, on average, a coefficient of determination ùëÖ2 of 87% w.r.t delay values from the EDA tool.
-   The MLP model using embedding feature vectors achieves an ùëÖ2 score of 79%. Training with an enlarged dataset, the best results are obtained by the MLP architecture using an embedding input layer. This approach reaches, on average, an ùëÖ2 of 77% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
0.68%. Both models are around 8.4√ó faster than the EDA tools.

###  This paper is organized as follows:
- briefly reviews concepts related to Timing Analysis (TA) and to ML applied to regressio tasks. 
- provides an overview of the delay estimation state of the art
- describes our ML solution.
-  provides details of the benchmark circuits used to evaluate our trained models.

### 2.1.  Timing Analysis (TA)
- TA is an EDA tool to determine whether a design works properly at the required clock period.
-  TA can be dynamic or static.
-  The dynamic analysis simulates the complete circuit using input vectors and evaluating the outputs.
-  STA is a static approach, as it propagates the gate delays from primary inputs to outputs. The gate delay is the time needed for a signal to propagate through a gate, i.e., going from input to output port .
-  STA highly depends on the delay values used for each gate in the whole design. STA tools obtain the delay values using a Non-linear Delay Model (NLDM).
-  For a constant output load, an increase in the input slew will reduce the delay. For a constant input transition,the delay will increase when the fanout capacitance increases.
-  The slew is propagated along the circuit. The output slew of a cell is the input
 slew of the next connected cell in the timing path.
- Output slews are also defined via LUTs with input slew and fanout load as indexes.
- An NLDM stores delay and slew LUTs in a technology library as the Synopsis
 Liberty file [6]. STA tools can read those liberty files.
- **In this paper, an NLDM is employed for extracting ground truth
 labels for the delay and slew values. The prediction of these metrics
 is defined as a multi-objective regression problem that can be solved
 using ML.**

### 2.2. ML for regression tasks
- In this paper, a model is trained to solve a regression task. The building blocks required to solve such a task using ML are:**(a) MLP (b) TabMLP**
  ###  Implemented ML Models

### ‚ùó Issues Faced
- Confused about how to extract SOG format
- Delay model accuracy low

### üìù Learnings
- Importance of fanout and slew in delay prediction
- SOG better represents timing than AST

### üîú Next Steps
- Try different feature encodings (embedding vs one-hot)
- Compare MLP vs Random Forest
