### ✅ Work Done
- Set up GitHub repo
- Extracted RTL delay features using OpenSTA
- Started reading MasterRTL paper (Section 3–5)

### ❗ Issues Faced
- Confused about how to extract SOG format
- Delay model accuracy low

### 📝 Learnings
- Importance of fanout and slew in delay prediction
- SOG better represents timing than AST

### 🔜 Next Steps
- Try different feature encodings (embedding vs one-hot)
- Compare MLP vs Random Forest
